## FED intern task 2020

To begin:

```
cd fed-intern-test-2020

npm install

npm start
```
### Findings
I found that the number of males that died were more than the number of females. This was probably because men were helping children and women to escape. From the graphs it can also be seen that more people died in in class 3 as compared to class 2 and class 1. This is because the people in class 1 and 2 were more rich/important persons and thus we allowed to escape the sinking the ship first.

### Approach
I first started with the table by using the Bootstrap table element. After that I implemented the filter feature, while I was working on the filter feature I also implemented the sorting feature for each column but later I removed it as it didn't add much to the application. Once the required task was completed I started working on the charts for which I used the Rechart library. I had to read Recharts decomentation as I have never used this library before. Once I was confident with the Recharts API, I implement the first chart (survival based on gender). Once I implemented the first chart, implementing others was pretty easy. After I got all the charts working I implemented the Tabs features which was pretty easy to implemented as I was already familar with Tabs API from React Bootstrap.
